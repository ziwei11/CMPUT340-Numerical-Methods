# CMPUT340-Introduction-to-Numerical-Methods
The study of computational methods for solving problems in linear algebra, non-linear equations, optimization, interpolation and approximation, and integration. Provide a basic foundation in numerical methods that supports further study in machine learning; computer graphics, vision and multimedia; robotics.

Lab1: The basics of Python and Numpy: Vectorized and Non-Vectorized Matrix Multiplication (Running Time)

Lab2: Two versions of the LU Factorization: 1. Non-Vectorized: forward_substituion, back_substituion 2. Vectorized

Lab3: Least Squares: Normal equation, Classic Gram-Schmidt, Modified Gram-Schmidt, Modified Gram-Schmidt with augmented matrix, Householder, and Library method residual norm

Lab4: QR Concrete, QR factorization

Lab5: Neural Network to Recognize Digits: MNIST_Gradient_Descent, Vectorized Implementation
